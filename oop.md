# Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming

## Module Overview and Learning Outcomes

In this Object-Oriented Programming module, I have strengthened my knowledge and hands-on experience in developing programs using Python, 
focusing on the core principles of object-oriented design such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. \
The course emphasised the use of the Unified Modelling Language (UML) to support the design process, enabling students to create a range of UML models. 
Additionally, I have gained experience in applying various data structures to efficiently store and manage data, 
as well as implementing simple search algorithms to process this data effectively. \
The module also covered the importance of design patterns in organising code, ensuring that students could create well-structured and maintainable software systems. 
By the end of the course, I will be proficient in developing object-oriented programs, preparing UML models, and utilising data structures and design patterns in my projects. \

## Assignments

#### Assignment 1: Driverless Vehicle System Design
**Assignment overview:** \
As a Software Engineer, you are given the role of designing the software which supports the operation of a self-driving car. 
You are required to identify three operations that you wish to support in your software and provision capability for them through 
the use of an object-oriented Python program. The system should support the ability for a customer to interact with the system through a front-end.
Running in the system back-end should be a capability that simulates the generation and collection of data attributes 
that represent the wider environment within which the driverless car is operating. \
Using the scenario provided, you are required to generate an object model for the proposed system. Use UML diagrams
(Use Case, Class, Activity, State and Sequence) and provision capability in your system to retain data within the 
following data structures: List, Stack, Queue, Dictionary. \
**Link**: [Assignment 1 directory](https://github.com/andaziemele/oop_module/tree/main/src/Unit_7/assignment_1)

#### Assignment 2: Driverless Vehicle System Implementation
**Assignment overview:** \
You are now required to implement Python code designed to support the operation of a driverless car as described in Assignment 1. 
This should be representative of the UML diagrams defined in your design document. Please do modify any of the diagrammatic 
capabilities in response to advancements in your thought process since the design document was submitted, or in response to feedback received. \
