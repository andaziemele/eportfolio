# Module 6: Secure Software Development

## Module Overview and Learning Outcomes

In the Secure Software Development (SSD) module, I developed my existing skills in Object-Oriented Programming and general knowledge in \
computer science, software engineering in the context of software security. I gained new skills in working with libraries such Flask, \
bandit and cryptography, which were used to create a secure shell app, and deeper knowledge in software design, particularly design patters \
such as the Model-View-Controller pattern. Discussion and forum activities on vulnerability analysis, risk management and secure architectures \
broadened my understanding of the field, and made me appreciate the need to ensure security is inherent in all development practices. \

## Assignments

#### Assignment 1: Project Report for a Computer Systems Design Project
**Assignment overview:** \
You are provided with a transcript between two (hypothetical) characters. You are required to analyse the transcript and 
extract the initial requirements of both stakeholders and critique them with respect to assumptions and gaps in what is provided. \
You (your group) are required to produce a proposal that details a suitable development methodology (e.g. waterfall or agile based) 
for the system under consideration, supported by a discussion that justifies the choice of methodology. 
You should also produce a set of requirements (derived from the supplied discussion transcript), 
a development plan with suitable milestones, proposed deliverables and an estimated cost of the system 
(based on the supplied BOMs and the miscellaneous information provided below). \

#### Assignment 2: Presentation for a Computer Systems Design Project
**Assignment overview:** \
Carrying on from the Full Brief, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a presentation of your response to the project challenges.
This submission should consist of a presentation to the major stakeholders that consists of a status/progress update and a 
plan and budget showing what changes are required to mitigate the challenges mentioned above, and 
how these will impact progress from design through to implementation and ultimately UAT. You should assume (as per your original plan) 
that a number of devices have already been produced. \
