# Module 6: Secure Software Development

## Module Overview and Learning Outcomes

In the Secure Software Development (SSD) module, I developed my existing skills in Object-Oriented Programming and general knowledge in 
computer science, software engineering in the context of software security. \
I gained new skills in working with libraries such Flask, 
bandit and cryptography, which were used to create a secure shell app, and deeper knowledge in software design, particularly design patterns 
such as the Model-View-Controller pattern. \
Discussion and forum activities on vulnerability analysis, risk management and secure architectures
broadened my understanding of the field, and made me appreciate the need to ensure security is inherent in all development practices.
The overall assignment challenged me in new ways - I had the opportunity to consider all aspects of Python programming I have learned so far - OOP techniques, application design, and secure code, testing and code quality. It was an excellent opportunity to round off the current course experience.

## Assignments

#### Assignment 1: Development Team Project: Design Document of a secure eCommerce CLI application
**Assignment overview:** \
Your team is expected to create a system design, describing how you will meet the requirements, and prepare this as a design document.\
In your document, you should detail the system requirements and assumptions influencing the design. You should identify the security challenges that the system has been designed to protect against.\
You should produce a minimum of two different UML designs which illustrate different views of the system, one of which should be a misuse case diagram (Pauli & Xu, 2005).\
You should also state the tools and libraries which you will use in your solution. You should describe how you are applying a solo developer (Pagotto et al., 2016) (Moyo & Mnkandla, 2020) approach to manage the project.

#### Assignment 2: Development Individual Project: Coding Output and Evidence of Testing
**Assignment overview:** \
Carrying on from the Full Brief provided in Unit 6, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a practical development of your design from Unit 6.\
The code should be developed using Python within any IDE. You should submit a fully tested code set. Code should be organised and documented according to Pythonâ€™s PEP-8 style guide (van Rossum, 2001).\
You should supply evidence of execution, demonstrating how the various aspects of the system work. Your code should also be tested and the evidence of this provided.\
Testing should be supported using unit tests which you have written, in addition to the use of linters. You should submit a README file that documents how the application can be run.
