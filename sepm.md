# Module 5: Software Engineering Project Management

## Module Overview and Learning Outcomes

In the Software Engineering Project Management (SEPM) module, I have developed my knowledge and practical experience in  
project management areas such as project cost and time estimation, software engineering project methodologies, risk management and quality management. \
The course covered a broad range of areas and provided an opportunity to engage in collaborative teamwork activities via Assignment 1,
coding exercises via e-Portfolio activities and in further reading on a range of topics such as handling emotional responses in project management,
code quality and wider software quality attributes amongst other topics. \
By the end of this module I will be proficient in software engineering principles in the context of project management, software development 
methodologies such as BDD and TDD, and have an appreciation for developments in this area.

## Assignments

#### Assignment 1: Project Report for a Computer Systems Design Project
**Assignment overview:** \
You are provided with a transcript between two (hypothetical) characters. You are required to analyse the transcript and 
extract the initial requirements of both stakeholders and critique them with respect to assumptions and gaps in what is provided. \
You (your group) are required to produce a proposal that details a suitable development methodology (e.g. waterfall or agile based) 
for the system under consideration, supported by a discussion that justifies the choice of methodology. 
You should also produce a set of requirements (derived from the supplied discussion transcript), 
a development plan with suitable milestones, proposed deliverables and an estimated cost of the system 
(based on the supplied BOMs and the miscellaneous information provided below). \

#### Assignment 2: Presentation for a Computer Systems Design Project
**Assignment overview:** \
Carrying on from the Full Brief, this assignment focuses on the second deliverable, a presentation of your response to the project challenges.
This submission should consist of a presentation to the major stakeholders that consists of a status/progress update and a 
plan and budget showing what changes are required to mitigate the challenges mentioned above, and 
how these will impact progress from design through to implementation and ultimately UAT. You should assume (as per your original plan) 
that a number of devices have already been produced. \
